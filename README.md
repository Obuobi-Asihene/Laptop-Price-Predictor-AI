This project, I use ML.NET to build a Machine Learning module that uses the specifications of a laptop such as the CPU, 
GHz, GPU, RAM, RAM Type, Screen (size), Storage, SSD (true or false) and Weight as input to predict the 
price (output) of a laptop.

- Using the data set provided, I trained an AI model to be able to predict the price of 
a laptop when given the input data stated above.

- Using MVC.NET, I built a simple user interface that will basically do 2 things:
 - Collect all the input data using a simple form
 - Using the AI model trained previously, predict the price of the laptop using the form data as 
input data to this model
